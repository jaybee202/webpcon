# WebpCon

## Inspiration
A friend told me to try OpenAI's updated image generation. After noticing that Spotify allows you to add your own custom playlist icons, I had the perfect use case. After quickly generating a few great images, I realized that ChatGPT's images are in .webp format, which is not compatible with Spotify (which requires .png or .jpg). Since I was already using ChatGPT, used it to create this program, README.txt, and requirements.txt in just seven prompts.

If you ever find yourself with a bunch of .webp files, you can use this program to convert them to .png or .jpgâ€”individually, by folder, or for an entire repository.

Please enjoy!
